## Setup Intructions

1. Using the command below, git clone this repository to your local computer.
    ```
    git clone https://gitlab.com/lee.seaver/project-beta.git
    ```

2.  Change directory to Project-Beta

    ```cd project-beta```

3. Run the following commands to setup docker.

    ```
    docker volume create beta-data
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up
    ```

### Creating Migrations:
When you change your models, you'll need to make and run migrations. Do not stop your services.

1. Run ``` docker exec -it «api-container-name» bash ``` to connect to the running service that contains your API service.

2. Run ``` python manage.py makemigrations ``` at the container command prompt. Make sure it generates the migration you expected.
3. Run ``` python manage.py migrate ``` to apply the migration.
4. Stop your poller service using Docker Desktop.
5. Start your poller service using Docker Desktop.

### Creating Superuser:

1. Run ```docker exec -it «api-container-name» bash``` to connect to the running service that contains an API service. Look for the services with the name "-api-" in them like in the image below.

2. Run  ```python manage.py createsuperuser ``` at the container command prompt and complete for form.

3. Open the correct URL for the microservice that you just created the superuser for:

    * Inventory: http://localhost:8100/admin/
    * Service: http://localhost:8080/admin/
    * Sales: http://localhost:8090/admin/

### Redo your database:
```
    You may need to destroy your database just to get it to a good state.
    You can follow these steps to do that:

        1. Stop all services

    docker container prune -f
    docker volume rm beta-data
    docker volume create beta-data
    docker-compose up
```
